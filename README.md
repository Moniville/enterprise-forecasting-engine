🌟 Why I Built This
I built this project because I was curious. I wanted to try something I had never done before: building a professional data tool from scratch.

Since this was a new area for me, I decided to collaborate with AI. Using AI helped me learn much faster and stay productive. It allowed me to build a high-quality tool while improving my own skills as an engineer.

🛠 What This Tool Does
Pulse AI helps you look at your past data and guess what might happen in the future. It’s perfect for people who need quick answers without being data experts.

Future Forecasts: Upload your data, and the tool predicts what your numbers will look like in the coming days, weeks, or months.

Performance Checks: Easily see how you are doing on a Monthly, Weekly, or Daily basis.

Spotting Errors: The tool automatically finds "Anomalies" (unusual spikes or drops in your data).

Easy Reports: You can download your results as a CSV file or a PDF report to share with others.

⚡ How I Built It (The "Vibe-Coding" Journey)
This project was built using a method called "Vibe-Coding." This means I didn't code alone—I worked with different AI models like a team to get the job done:

Gemini (Google): Helped me build the main foundation and the core logic of the app.

Claude: I used Claude to help fix specific problems that Gemini and I couldn't solve together.

DeepSeek: When I wasn't happy with Claude’s suggestions, I switched to DeepSeek to refine the code and make it work perfectly.

🤖 A Note on the AI Chat
I tried to add an "AI Analyst" chat feature, but I realized the AI wasn't giving 100% accurate answers yet. Because I want this tool to be reliable, I decided to pause that feature for now.

Status: "Sorry. 🤖 AI is currently not reliable at the moment. We are working on it...."

🧰 Tools Used
Python: The "brain" of the app.

Streamlit: Makes the app look like a clean, easy-to-use website.

Prophet: The tool that calculates the future forecasts.

Supabase: A database used to save feedback from users.
